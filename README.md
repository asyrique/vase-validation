# Problem
Businesses spend a lot of time on validating ideas, and sometimes they can't tell the results even after multiple user interviews.

# Description
Vase is a platform that allows businesses to easily create, target, and deploy surveys to their target market. The Vase team believes that by designing a simple user interface, business owners who are not tech savvy will be able to deploy their surveys with ease. Vase provides cash incentives for respondents (we call them Vasers!), and we verify Vaser's identity by connecting to their social media account to prevent fraud in answering surveys which will yield false results. For each question Vasers answer, they will receive RM1 immediately. Vasers can earn up to RM20 per day for their effort in answering surveys. Businesses can also offer their services as a return for Vasers' effort, allowing Vases to try the latest invention before anybody else. This also allows businesses to gauge their idea, whether it is more attractive compared to money incentives. Grow your user base with Vase now!

#Name
The name Vase is derived from VaaS, which means Validation-as-a-Service.
